## East Bay Young Democrats

East Bay Young Democrats are looking to determine which of the democratic candidates they should endorse.
They need to conduct a vote of their membership, but don't have a good platform for it.
They're also curious about alternative voting methods, and would like one platform that can use whatever voting method works
best for them.

They'd like the experience to be very simple for their members, but secure so that member information or preferences isn't leaked 
to anyone outside of the EBYD leadership.
They'd like to be able to audit the voter roll to insure against double voting or fudging.
